![Repository logo](/img/bg.jpg)
A simple demo that compares video quality (PSNR/SSIM) across various codecs, bitrates, and levels of motion to study how compression affects dynamic scenes.  

*Great for anyone who wants to get started with video quality evaluation.*

# WORK IN PROGRESS
## Description


`vidmetrics-dynamics-demo` is an approachable project that demonstrates how video compression affects perceived quality using objective metrics such as **PSNR** and **SSIM**, with a focus on **scene dynamics** (amount of motion), **codecs**, **bitrates**, and **resolutions**.

This project is ideal for anyone interested in video quality evaluation, media encoding, or understanding how different codecs impact video quality, especially in dynamic scenes.
        


### What is going to happen?

1.  The project begins with **2 original source video files** containing varying levels of motion.
    
2.  It processes these files and generates **50 output files** with the following parameters:
    
    -   **3 codecs**: H.264, H.265, VP9
        
    -   **8 bitrates**: 100 kbps, 500 kbps, 1000 kbps, 2000 kbps, 3000 kbps, 4000 kbps, 5000 kbps, 6000 kbps
        
    -   **2 resolutions**: 720p and 1080p
        
    -   Plus **reference (uncompressed)** files for comparison
        
3.  The output files are compared against the source files using:
    
    -   **PSNR** (Peak Signal-to-Noise Ratio)
        
    -   **SSIM** (Structural Similarity Index)
        
4.  The results are aggregated and analyzed to:
    
    -   Compare quality degradation across different codecs, bitrates, and resolutions
        
    -   Draw conclusions about which settings perform best in specific scenarios

## Prerequisites*
### FFmpeg 
#### Windows
**Download**
1. Go to the [FFmpeg Download page](https://ffmpeg.org/download.html).
2. Choose Windows and click the "Windows builds from gyan.dev"
3. Download the appropriate version. If you don't know which one is right for you, it's usually `ffmpeg-git-full.7z`
4. Extract the ZIP file somewhere, for example `C:\ffmpeg`

**Verify**
1. Open **Command Prompt**
2. type:
```bash
ffmpeg -version
```
3. If everything is correctly installed, you should see FFmpeg version information.
```bash
ffmpeg version 2025-03-31-git-35c091f4b7-full_build-www.gyan.dev Copyright (c) 2000-2025 the FFmpeg developers
built with gcc 14.2.0 (Rev1, Built by MSYS2 project)
```
